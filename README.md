# RUSH-Vesicle-Analysis
A FIJI / ImageJ macro to measure number of cytoplasmic vesicles in Z-stack microscopy images

# Goal
The macro faciliates the quantification of cytoplasmic vesicles in cells. This macro was designed for retention using selective hooks (RUSH) constructs (Boncompain et al. 2012). It will also work for any other construct or probe that labels vesicular structures.

# Installation
Simply copy the macro file to your macro folder in your [Fiji](https://imagej.net/Fiji) directory and restart Fiji. You can access the macro from the Plugin section in Fiji.
