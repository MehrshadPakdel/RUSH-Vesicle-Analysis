# RUSH-Vesicle-Analysis
A FIJI / ImageJ macro to measure number of cytoplasmic vesicles in Z-stack microscopy images

# Goal
The macro faciliates the quantification of cytoplasmic vesicles in Z-stack microscopy images. This macro was designed for retention using selective hooks (RUSH) constructs (Boncompain et al. 2012). Additionally, the macro will allow to quantify vesicle numbers of reporters that are retained in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) by using a ER marker as a co-stain. It will also work for any other construct or probe that label vesicular structures.

# Installation
Simply copy the macro file to your macro folder in your [Fiji](https://imagej.net/Fiji) directory and restart Fiji. You can access the macro from the Plugin section in Fiji.

# Usage
Acquire Z-stacks of cells expressing your reporter or labeled with the probe of your interest.

* Single channel images with reporter only

* Dual channel images with ER co-stain
